# MapSOS Privacy Policy

## 1) What Information is Collected and Why?

MapSOS determines the user's location using GPS and calculates it in multiple coordinate formats: -

- UTM
- Latitude/Longitude
- CH1903 if within the Swiss Grid area
- OS Grid References if within the Ordnance Survey National Grid of Great Britain. 

MapSOS does not store this information.

If the user so chooses, they may share this location information via SMS/Message, Email, GPX file or simply as text via the iOS clipboard. The user decides what information to include, and to whom it is sent. 

If a user requires support, then they can, at their own choice, send an email to info@arcdale.com. The app will in this case show information on settings that can be appended to the email to assist in debugging. None of these settings are personal in any sense, and the user may delete even that information before sending the email.

## 2) With whom is information shared?

As detailed in section 1, the user may choose to share their location, and decide to whom the location information is sent. Information is only sent to those whom the user explicitly chooses.

No information is shared with 3rd parties.  If debug information is shared,  as detailed in section 1, then it is sent by email to arcdale.com at the user's choice.

## 3) How is information shared?

As detailed in section 1, the user may share location information to other parties via SMS/Message, Email or GPX file.  The user can also copy their location information to the iOS clipboard, and from there use it as they wish.

No information other than that detailed in section 1 is shared.  If debug information is shared,  as detailed in section 1, then it is sent by email to arcdale.com  at the user's choice.

## 4) What is your control of your information?

Sharing of location is entirely under the control of the user. It is never shared except as directed by the user.

If debug information is shared,  as detailed in section 1, then the app will show you the non-personal settings that would be sent to aid debug, but you are free to delete even this information from the email before sending it if you so choose.

## 5) Changes to this privacy policy

If this policy were to change, then a notice of the changes will be made in the app update description, and in the app itself.
