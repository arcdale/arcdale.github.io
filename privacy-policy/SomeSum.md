# SomeSum Privacy Policy

## 1) What Information is Collected and Why?

No personal information of any kind is collected, stored or transmitted by this app. If, and only if, a user requests support, then they can, at their own choice, send an email to info@arcdale.com. The app will in this case show information on settings that can be appended to the email to assist in debugging. None of these settings are personal in any sense, and the user may delete even that information before sending the email.

## 2) With whom is information shared?

No information is shared with 3rd parties.  If debug information is shared,  as detailed in section 1, then it is sent by email to arcdale.com at the user's choice.

## 3) How is information shared?

No information other than that detailed in section 1  is shared.  If debug information is shared,  as detailed in section 1, then it is sent by email to arcdale.com  at the user's choice.

## 4) What is your control of your information?

No personal information is stored at all.  If debug information is shared,  as detailed in section 1, then the app will show you the non-personal settings that would be sent to aid debug, but you are free to delete even this information from the email before sending it if you so choose.

## 5) Changes to this privacy policy

If this policy were to change, then a notice of the changes will be made in the app update description, and in the app itself.
